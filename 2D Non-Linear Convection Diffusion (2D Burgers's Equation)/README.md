The following results present simulations of 2D Non-linear Convection Diffusion using the finite difference method. For the animated visualizations (GIFs), a forward-in-time discretization was applied in combination with the generalized upwind scheme for the spatial convection terms and central scheme for diffusion terms in both the x and y directions for different initial condtion.
